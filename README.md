## 🔥 About Me
I'm a Full Stack Developer passionate about building real, meaningful web applications using modern JavaScript technologies. I recently completed my Full Stack Development Internship at CodeAlpha, where I developed:
A full E-commerce Store (frontend +
backend)
A Mini Social Media App with posts, likes,
and comments
I enjoy solving problems, creating clean Ul, and connecting frontend with backend systems using REST APIs.
Currently pursuing BSCS, and continuously improving my skills in:
JavaScript | HTML | CSS | Node.js | Express.js | Git |
APIs | MongoDB (learning)
I'm focused on becoming a strong MERN Stack
Developer and building projects that help me grow in real-world development.

I believe in learning by building. Every day is a chance to improve.
